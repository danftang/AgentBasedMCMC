\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}\label{sec:background}

Data assimilation (DA) is a technique that has been widely used in the physical sciences such as meteorology~\cite{kalnay_atmospheric_2003}, oceanography~\cite{bertino_sequential_2003} and the earth sciences more broadly~\cite{reichle_data_2008}. Specific applications of DA to ABMs are much rarer. Examples of data assimilation using well known DA methods such as Particle Filters and variants of the Kalman Filter applied to ABMs include models of crime~\cite{lloyd_exploring_2016}, bus routes~\cite{kieu_dealing_2020}, pedestrian dynamics~\cite{wang_data_2015, ward_dynamic_2016, clay_realtime_2020, malleson_simulating_2020};
and population movement~\cite{lueck_who_2019}. Many DA algorithms rely on the differentiability of the model~\cite{lewis_dynamic_2006}.
